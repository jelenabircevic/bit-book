BitBook

Simple Facebook-like single page app, written in React.js, as a final team project for the JavaScript course at BIT.

The app supports registering/logging in, creating and editing a profile, a profile search function, posting and deleting new text, image and video posts, as well as commenting.

The central page is the feed, which shows all the posts by all the users (which can be filtered by type) and utilizes infinite scroll.

The design is fully responsive and based on SemanticUI.
